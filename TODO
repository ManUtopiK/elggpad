TODO:

Major:
	Sessions, Currently not successfully passing sessionID through to 
		etherpad lite server, causing failed authentication.
	Private pads, Requires successfull authentication with etherpad lite.
	Group pads, Requires successfull authentication with etherpad lite, 
		fix group ownership of pads (elgg), fix group module.

Minor:
	Add pad description to etherpad page. As a comment?
	
Thinking about:
	Feature: Save button, Saves current pad contents to blog/page. 
		(Will require blog and/or page plugins to be activated)
